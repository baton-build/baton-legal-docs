## 1. Introduction
Baton Software Limited (“**Baton**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”) provides cloud-based business software for the construction industry. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of personal information entrusted to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

> If you access Baton because your employer or the company you work for has provisioned your account, please read **Section 4 (Who is the controller?)**—in many cases, your employer is the data controller and Baton acts as a processor on their instructions.


## 2. Who we are & how to contact us
**Controller (for the processing we control—see Section 4):**  
**Baton Software Limited** (Company No. **16657849**)  
Registered office: Burgundy House, 24 The Forresters, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, AL5 2FB, United Kingdom

**Privacy contact (data rights & questions):** **privacy@baton.build**

We aim to respond within one month and sooner for simple requests.

## 3. Personal data we process
Depending on how you use Baton, we may process:

- Identification details (name, job title, contact information)  
- Worker qualifications and certifications (as provided by client organisations)  
- National Insurance and other tax-related details (for wage-related calculations requested by clients)  
- Login/authentication events and access logs (credential management handled by Azure; see Section 7)  
- Employment/project information entered by client organisations  
- Technical data (browser, device, IP address, usage logs, diagnostics)

Data is typically provided by **client organisations** who authorise and manage access for their workers, or generated through your use of the Service (e.g., logs).

---

## 4. Who is the controller?
- **Client-provided workforce data.** For personal data about workers that a client organisation inputs into Baton, the **client is the data controller** and Baton acts as a **data processor** on the client’s instructions (see our DPA at https://baton.build/legal?doc=dpa  ).  
- **Baton-operated data.** Baton is the **controller** for limited activities (e.g., our website analytics, account admin contacts, billing, service communications, product telemetry that does not identify individuals, and security monitoring tied to service integrity).

When Baton acts as **processor**, your rights requests (access, deletion, etc.) should be sent to your **employer/client organisation** (the controller). We will support them under our DPA.

---

## 5. How we use personal data (purposes & legal bases)
We use personal data to:
- Provide, secure, and maintain the Baton platform  
- Create and manage user access for authorised users  
- Support onboarding, customer service, and technical maintenance  
- Run wage-related or project-related calculations as configured by the client  
- Meet legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., security, fraud prevention)  
- Improve the platform, including quality, reliability, and user experience

**Legal bases:** contractual necessity, legitimate interests (e.g., service security/improvement), legal obligations, and consent where required for optional uses. When we act as **processor**, the client sets the legal basis.

---

## 6. Data sharing
We share personal data only with:
- The relevant **client organisation** (your employer or the company that granted your access)  
- Our vetted **service providers** acting on our behalf under data-processing terms (see Section 8)  
- Authorities or third parties where required by law or to protect rights, safety, or security

We do **not** sell personal data.

---

## 7. How and where your data is stored
- **MongoDB Atlas (UK/EU)** – primary application database for worker/project data (including qualifications and wage-related inputs).  
- **Microsoft Azure (UK/EU)** – identity and authentication services; **credentials/tokens only** (no worker profile data stored in Azure identity by design).  
- **Operational tooling** – limited admin/support tools used by Baton (processor terms in place; see Section 8).

All systems use encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest, role-based access controls, logging, and least-privilege access.

---

## 8. Sub-processors
We maintain a live list of our authorised sub-processors (with roles, locations, and safeguards) here:  
**https://baton.build/legal?doc=subprocessors**

That page is kept current and forms part of our Data Processing Agreement (DPA). It may include hosting/database providers, authentication services, ticketing/support platforms, and development partners used to deliver the Service.

---

## 9. International transfers
Where personal data is accessed from or transferred to countries outside the UK/EEA, we implement appropriate safeguards—such as the **UK International Data Transfer Addendum** and/or **EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**—and supplementary measures. Support or engineering personnel may remotely access data solely as necessary to provide the Service and subject to these safeguards.

---

## 10. Security
We operate an information-security programme including:
- Encryption at rest and in transit  
- Role-based access, MFA for admin, and periodic access reviews  
- Secure development lifecycle, vulnerability management, and change control  
- Centralised logging/monitoring and incident response  
- Backups and disaster-recovery procedures

No system is perfectly secure, but we work hard to protect your data from unauthorised access, loss, or misuse.

---

## 11. Data retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes above, to comply with law, or to resolve disputes. When data is no longer needed, we delete or anonymise it. For client data where we are **processor**, retention follows the client’s instructions and our DPA (including post-termination export/deletion windows).

---

## 12. Your rights
Subject to UK GDPR, you may have rights to:
- Access a copy of your personal data  
- Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data  
- Erase data (in certain circumstances)  
- Restrict or object to processing  
- Data portability (where applicable)

**If your employer/client is the controller:** please contact your employer first; we will assist them under our DPA.  
**If Baton is the controller for your data:** contact **privacy@baton.build**.

We may need to verify your identity before acting on a request.

---

## 13. Complaints
You can contact us at **privacy@baton.build**. You also have the right to complain to the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)**: https://www.ico.org.uk.

---

## 14. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post updates here with a new “Last updated” date, and we may notify administrators or users for significant changes.
