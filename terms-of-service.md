## 1. Introduction
These Terms & Conditions (the **“Agreement”**) govern the use of the Baton software and related services (**“Baton”**, the **“Service”**) provided by **Baton Software Limited** (**“Baton”, “we”, “us”**).

Each Party may disclose Confidential Information where required by law, after giving prompt notice (where lawful).

The parties acknowledge that any pricing, commercial terms, discounts or preferential rates agreed between them have been specifically negotiated on a confidential basis and form part of the Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement. Neither Party shall disclose such pricing or commercial terms to any third party without the prior written consent of the other, except as permitted under this clause.

**11.3 Disclaimers.** Except as expressly stated, the Service is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** Baton disclaims all implied warranties including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Baton does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor that it is designed for high-risk use cases (e.g., safety-critical systems).

---

## 12. Suspension
Baton may suspend access to the Service immediately if: (a) Client fails to pay Fees when due; (b) Client breaches security or acceptable-use obligations; or (c) suspension is required to address a material security risk. Baton will lift suspension once the issue is resolved.

Where suspension arises due to non-payment of Fees, any specifically agreed pricing, discounts, incentives or commercial terms previously offered may, at Baton’s discretion, be withdrawn or revised. Baton reserves the right to reinstate services on its then-current standard pricing and commercial terms following such suspension.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
**13.1 Unlimited Liabilities.** Nothing excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.

**13.2 Excluded Damages.** Neither Party is liable for lost profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.

**13.3 Liability Cap.** Subject to Clauses 13.1–13.2, each Party’s total aggregate liability in any 12-month period is limited to the Fees paid or payable by Client for the Service in that period.

---

## 14. Term & Termination
**14.1 Term.** This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues for the Subscription Term specified in the Order.

---

## 20. Assignment
Client may not assign or transfer this Agreement without Baton’s consent, except to an affiliate or in a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the assignee is not a competitor and agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

## 21A. Audit & Usage Verification
Upon reasonable notice and not more than once per year (unless a material breach is suspected), Baton may request information reasonably necessary to verify Client’s compliance with the Authorised User and usage limits in the Order. Any audit will minimise disruption, protect confidentiality, and be at Baton’s expense unless material non-compliance is found.

---

## 22. Severability; Waiver
If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. Failure to enforce is not a waiver.
